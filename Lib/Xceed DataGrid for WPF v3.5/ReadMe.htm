			<span class="SousTitre1">Copyright © 2007-2009 Xceed Software Inc.</span></h1>
		<h2 class="Titre2">Introduction</h2>
		<p class="Txt">Thank you for installing Xceed DataGrid for WPF.&nbsp;The 
			Professional Edition of Xceed DataGrid for WPF<STRONG> </STRONG>is&nbsp;not 
			only the most mature and therefore rock-solid, time-tested grid control for 
			Microsoft's Windows Presentation Foundation on the market. It's also the most 
			powerful, with more features than any other offering and a flexible, extensible 
			object model. Add that it's the fastest and that it provides unbeatable 
			performance, handling millions of rows and thousands of columns while 
			delivering an exceptional user experience, and it becomes easy to understand 
			why it's the most-adopted WPF datagrid available: its tens of thousands of 
			users know they have the best and regularly say so on one of the most active 
			WPF forums around!</p>
		<P class="Txt">Xceed DataGrid for WPF is also available as a Standard Edition. This 
			alternative to Microsoft's free datagrid lets&nbsp;developers create better 
			apps faster, at an economical price.</P>
		<P class="Txt">Xceed DataGrid for WPF is available in cost-effective team and site 
			licenses. Standard e-mail support is provided, but adding a Vanguard 
			subscription gives you upgrades and priority support for an entire year. Full 
			C# and XAML source code is available in the Blueprint Edition.</P>
		<P class="Txt">Both versions provide comprehensive documentation that fully 
			integrates into Visual Studio, and C# and VB.NET sample applications.</P>
		<H2 class="Titre2">What's new in version 3.5</H2>
		<P class="Txt" style="Z-INDEX: 0">
			Xceed DataGrid for WPF Professional Edition v3.5 features a beautiful new view 
			called Tableflow&trade; View. This view offers fast animated smooth scrolling 
			(with inertia) for impressive UI performance, (works with data virtualization), 
			sticky group headers, sticky master-detail master row and headers, full-column 
			animated drag &amp; drop reordering. Also new is filtering in a virtualized 
			collection view, and status indicator glyphs. Various minor bugs have been 
			addressed. Version 3.5 of Xceed DataGrid for WPF Standard Edition features 
			various minor bug fixes.</P>
		<P class="Txt"><STRONG>Professional Edition users</STRONG></P>
		<P class="Txt">A registered Professional Edition version 3.5 license key or later 
			is required to unlock this version. New features of the Professional Edition of 
			version 3.5 will only be&nbsp;unlocked with a Professional Edition version 3.5 
			license key. A Professional Edition version 3.2 license key will only unlock 
			bug fixes.</P>
		<P class="Txt"><STRONG>Standard&nbsp;Edition users</STRONG></P>
		<P class="Txt">
			A registered&nbsp;Standard Edition version 3.5 license key or later is required 
			to unlock this version.</P>
		<P class="Txt"><STRONG>Express Edition users</STRONG></P>
		<P class="Txt">The Express Edition has been discontinued and replaced by the 
			Standard Edition as of version 3.2.&nbsp;The final version of the Express 
			Edition (v3.1) will remain available for download in Xceed's Update Center. 
			Registered version 3.1 Express Edition license keys will only unlock version 
			3.1 of the Express Edition. The Standard Edition of Xceed DataGrid for WPF v3.2 
			does&nbsp;<STRONG>not</STRONG> support v3.1 Express Edition license keys.</P>
		<H2 class="Titre2">Installing</H2>
		<p class="Txt">The installer copies all the control's files to the appropriate 
			locations, but you still need to take additional steps to make the component 
			available from your particular development environment. To do this, please 
			consult the <EM>Licensing (Unlocking) the Component</EM> topic in the 
			documentation and follow all the steps.</p>
		<h2 class="Titre2">Licensing</h2>
		<p class="Txt">
			To use Xceed DataGrid for WPF, the LicenseKey property should be set to either 
			a registered license key that you have purchased&nbsp;or a trial key. Trial 
			keys for both the Professional Edition and the Standard Edition can be obtained 
			from the Resource Center application, which can be&nbsp;run from&nbsp;the Start 
			Menu&nbsp;under All Programs -&gt; Xceed DataGrid for WPF vX.X -&gt; Xceed 
			DataGrid for WPF vX.X Resource Center.&nbsp;</p>
		<P class="Txt">
			The&nbsp;component&nbsp;remains fully functional for the trial period, which 
			begins at the time of installation and lasts for 45 days. Once the trial period 
			has ended, a registered license key is needed to continue using the product. If 
			you attempt to use&nbsp;a component after the trial period without a registered 
			license key, an exception will be thrown and you will not be able to use it.</P>
		<P class="Txt">Xceed&nbsp;DataGrid for WPF&nbsp;<STRONG>may</STRONG> be used 
			without a license key for&nbsp;the 45-day trial period; by default, the 
			Professional Edition of the product is active when no license key is explicitly 
			set during the trial period. This is <STRONG>not</STRONG> however recommended: 
			you should always license the component explicitly to avoid licensing issues. 
			If, during the trial period, you wish to test your application on another 
			computer, you <STRONG>must</STRONG> assign a key to the LicenseKey property 
			as&nbsp;described above.
		</P>
		<P class="Txt">If you have purchased a registered license key, assigning it to the 
			LicenseKey property will remove the trial limitations. The LicenseKey property 
			must be set with a valid license key before any method of your Xceed component 
			is called. If you use an invalid or expired license key, fail to license the 
			control with a registered license key after the trial period, or license it in 
			the wrong place in your code, an exception will be thrown at runtime.</P>
		<P class="Txt">For more information on how the 45-day trial works or how to license 
			the component once you purchase, refer to the&nbsp;<EM>Licensing (Unlocking) the 
				Component</EM>&nbsp;topic in the documentation.</SPAN></P>
		<h2 class="Titre2">Distributing</h2>
		<p class="Txt">Both signed and unsigned versions of <STRONG>Xceed DataGrid for WPF</STRONG>
			assemblies are available. Either version can be distributed, but please 
			remember that signed software of any kind can sometimes cause problems because 
			the .NET Framework or the operating system must contact an authentication 
			server, which can in turn trigger firewall alerts, etc.</p>
		<p class="Txt">Please note: Only the files specifically identified in the 
			documentation as Redistributable Files can be distributed. You may not 
			redistribute the Xceed installation package, nor any portion of Xceed DataGrid 
			for WPF except for the Redistributable Files.</p>

			terms and conditions of the <a href="http://xceed.com/pages/TopMenu/Company/LicensesAgreement.aspx?lang=EN-CA">
				Xceed Software License Agreement</a> that accompanies the software.</SPAN>
